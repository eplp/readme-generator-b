3. Download ZIP the code file from the 'main' branch.
4. Navigate to a local directory where you already have git and node installed. If you don't have these tools installed in your local machine, follow the instructions found at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
5. Unzip the code file in such way that the extracted folder \readme-generator-b is under your git folder (see above).
6. Open a terminal (VS Code or git bash).
7. Change directory as needed to be inside the 'main' branch.
8. Run the command: 'node init' to install all dependencies associated with the application.
9. Link your local repo to your remote repo. Follow any of the many instruction sets available in the web to accomplish this task. The following link may assist you: [Add existing project to Git](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e).
10. Delete the README.md file from the root directory in your local machine.
11. Start the application by running the comand: 'node index.js'
12. Read the Help instructions displayed at the console/terminal.
13. When the application finishes, stage and commit changes in the local main branch (the README.md and badge.svg files) to your remote repo.
